DAW Proyecto.
Proyecto fin de ciclo de Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Web DAW.
Mi proyecto de Ilerna Online consiste en una p√°gina web para la venta y el alquiler de juegos de mesa entre particulares. 


SENET is a Web Site designed to rent or buy board games between private parties.

1.  First, when the user access to the Web Site SENET, he has the possibility to login/logout, see a description of the main object of the web site and look for board games close to him. 
2.  Once registered, all the activities of creation-modification or elimination of any data will be registered in the Database with a reference to the user Id. The user can access to register his board games. In this layout, the user has the possibility to register new board games that he wants to sell or rent. If a user wants to rent o buy a board game, he has to be login. 
3.  Then he will have access to a list of games, choose the ones he wants and confirm his order. 
The tools involved to create the web Page are: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, PHP, SQL, and the framework Bootstrap.
